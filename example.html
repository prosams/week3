<h1>Example Entries</h1>

<h2>These are all from my most recent journals from the past two years!</h2>

<!-- exletter.jpg -->
<p>I made this page when I wanted to dip my toes into calligraphy. It's not exactly super fancy script, but I (personally) think it looks cool. It was also a great way to destress — all I had to do was write some letters over and over.</p>

<!-- excollage.JPG -->
<img src="images/excollage.JPG" alt="collage paris tickets">
<p>This page has some souvenirs from when I travelled to France. Keeping ticket stubs is a little cliche, but if you never show anyone your journal, who's to judge? I also sometimes like to tape receipts into my journals. They're one of those things that are unbelievably common, but carry a lot of information (purchasing habits, etc) and are interesting to have in 10 years.</p>

<img src="images/excollage2.jpg" alt="perfume samples">
<p>These cards are the ones that they give out as perfume samples. I liked how they looked (and now my journal sort of smells like the perfume!).</p>

<!-- extape.JPG -->
<img src="images/extape.JPG" alt="tape imprint">
<p>One of my favorite things about journalling is that you can put whatever you want in it. This is from a used book I bought—there was a piece of tape on the inside and when I peeled it off, it left an imprint of the text. Doesn't really serve any practical purpose or meaning other than looking cool.</p>

<!-- exdraw.JPG -->

<p>I don't consider myself to be all that artistic, but sometimes I'm in the mood for some drawing. Here's a frog I whipped up when I was feeling especially down.</p>

<!-- exentry.jpg -->
<img src="images/exentry.jpg" alt="perfume page entry">
<p>Here's a perfume page I have tabbed! Not everything I write is as neat as this (some might not even consider this neat) but it's an example of a page that I like looking back on for organizational purposes.</p>

<p>There's a lot of random things in my journal. I hope these encouraged you to try something new!</p>
