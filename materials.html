<h1>What's in a Pen?</h1>

<p>Among the many choices you have for journalling are the sorts of materials you use. It's easy to feel overwhelmed! Sometimes there's a misconception that you have to have a certain set of pens, papers, inks, or stickers to ACTUALLY journal. None of this is true — all you need is motivation, a journal, and a writing utensil. But if you're looking for a rundown, here's a broad overview of what I like to use when journalling.</p>

<p>Writing Utensils - Other than the actual journal itself, the writing utensils are, for me, the bread and butter of exciting journalling. Different inks and nib sizes create drastically different effects on the page.</p>

<!-- crayola -->

<p>Crayola Markers: Cheap, portable, and reliable, these markers have never let me down. Not only are the mini versions (Pipsqueaks) adorable, they're also easily replacable if you ever lose them. The chisel tips are also great for coloring in entire pages (if that's something you're into).</p>

<!-- zig.JPG -->
<img src="images/zig.JPG" alt="zig clean color markers">
<p>ZIG Clean Color Markers: A step up from your standard Crayolas with a smoother, rounded tip that is unlikely to feather over time. I like how they have a thin and thick tip! These aren't usually sold in stores (maybe art stores?) — you're better off trying to find them online.</p>

<!-- mildliner.jpg -->

<p>ZEBRA Mildliner Highlighters: These are huge in the stationary world. They're unique because they aren't too aggressive — almost every one of the shades is a similar sort of pastel, muted color, which is very different from the typical bright neon highlighter. Like the ZIG markers, these are dual ended, with a standard highlighter tip on one side and a finer tip marker on the other. I like to write down interesting quotes with these.</p>

<!-- g2.JPG -->
<img src="images/g2.JPG" alt="g2 pens">
<p>G2 Pens: Pretty standard pens. Available pretty widely and have a medium assortment of colors if you're not a fan of having too many options. Not my favorite gel pens — I prefer Gelly Rolls or pens with a heavier inkflow, but I really like the G2 ones for taking notes.</p>

<!-- gellyroll.JPG -->
<img src="images/gellyroll.JPG" alt="gell roll pens">
<p>Sakura Moonlight Gelly Roll Pens: My favorite gel pens! Super neon, extremely opaque, and have a nib size of .9 mm, which is extremely satisfying to write with. They show up equally well on dark or light paper.</p>

<!-- sparklepop.JPG -->
<img src="images/sparklepop.JPG" alt="pentel sparkle pop pens">
<p>Pentel Sparkle Pop Pens: These pens are the glitter pens to end all glitter pens. Like the Moonlight Gelly Roll Pens, the Pentel Sparkle Pops have a thicker nib size of .9 mm. They also have a neat duochrome effect — the shimmer suspended in the ink isn't quite the same color as the ink fluid, so, for example, the black pen looks red from a certain angle while the purple pen shift blue in another.</p>

<!-- stickers.JPG -->
<p>Stickers: Full disclosure — I collect stickers! I'm especially fond of goofy ones — I have a bunch of food stickers and even ones of a little blob dinosaur. I'll put these on pages when I'm feeling especially decorative or even sometimes to emphasize entries. They're also great for decorating your journal itself.</p>

<!-- washi.JPG -->
<p>Washi Tape: If you haven't heard of washi tape, it's basically just the tape version of a sticker. They're useful for decorating borders or taping in any material that you might want to collage (although sometimes a gluestick serves a more practical purpose).</p>

<!-- tabs.JPG -->
<p>Tabs: I use these for making note of any journal entries that I want to look back on later — maybe I've made a cool list or a pretty page that I want to keep.</p>

<!-- other.JPG -->
<p>Other things: These are just useful extras that I find myself reaching for when journalling. Sometimes I write things down on a sticky note and then glue or tape it in to emphasize something. Sometimes I cut things out of magazines.</p>
