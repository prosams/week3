<h1>Journalling Prompts</h1>

<h2>Some things to think about when trying to get started with a new journal:</h2>
<p>- What do you want to get out of this journal?
  Sometimes people have very specific goals, like writing todo lists or tracking calories, and sometimes people have broader goals, such as becoming a better writer by the end of the journal or developing a more complete sense of self. Regardless of which of these you gravitate towards, it helps to think about how keeping a journal might contribute to your life.</p>

<p>- How often are you going to journal?
  In high school, I tried to write every single day. That's become a lot harder to do in college. At times, I'd go weeks without writing a word in my journal, which would snowball into a sort of indifference about journalling at all. My logic was that by failing my own goals so badly, there was no point in even trying to continue. Why not just start again the next year?
  Since then, I try to set "soft" journalling goals rather than firm ones. I think of it more as an outlet than a requirement, which means I write whenever I can and don't get mad at myself if I can't.</p>

<p>â€” What's your risk level?
  About ten years ago or so, I came home to find my sister reading my journal in a corner. The level of outrage and violation I felt is still fresh in my memory.
  If you're going to be recording a lot of sensitive information in your journal, it might help to either anonymize names or even use some sort of code so that only you can understand what you're writing about. Or, if there's a chance of someone finding your journal (like my nosy sister), it might help to just not write about sensitive information at all.
  Regardless, thinking about whether or not you care about others reading what you say is something to consider going into it.</p>

<p>Here are some more specific prompts to consider when you're stuck on an entry:</p>
<ul>

<li>What's something good that happened today?</li>
<li>Who are the most important people in your life and why?</li>
<li>How have you changed in the past day, week, month, or year?</li>
<li>Any plot twists you've had in your life?</li>
<li>What makes us human?</li>
<li>What's the nicest thing anyone has ever done for you?</li>
</ul>
